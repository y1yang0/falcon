**Falcon** is a statically-typed, high-level programming language. It is designed to be a simple and easy-to-understand language for business purposes. The language is still in development and is **not ready for production use**. If you do not care about the risks, then please go ahead and try it out.

# Getting Started
Falcon is in early development, but we still prepare a simple [language manual](docs/manual.md) for aficionado.

You can check out the examples in the [src/test/](src/test/algorithm_test.go) directory. **This is also recommended approach to learn Falcon**.

# Build
> [!NOTE]
> **GCC toolchain is required** to build the project, because we rely on its assembler and linker.

`Linux+x86_64` is the official supported combination for now.
Other platforms may work, but are not tested/guaranteed.

Or simply use the `try.sh` script to compile and run the program:
```bash
$ ./try.sh
```

Before submiting your awesome patch, please at least run these tests:
```bash
$ ./test.sh
```
